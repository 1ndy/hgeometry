#+STARTUP: showeverything

* Changelog

** 0.10

- renamed the smallest enclosing ball to RIC
- improved tangency finding on convex hulls/chains
- changes to how we order points in ccwCmpAround and cwCmpAround;
  these will report EQ if points appear at the same angle from the
  center point.
- new functions ccwCmpAroundWith and cwCmpAroundWith that allow you to
  specify the direction corresponding to "zero".
- bugfixes

** 0.9

- Implemented 2D Linear Programming using randomized incremental
  construction (in \(O(n)\) expected time). This allows us to solve
  the following problems
  - testing starshapedness of simple polygons in expected linear time
  - testing if we can separate a set of red and a set of blue points
    in expected linear time.
- Data types for halfspaces

** 0.8

- Compatibility with GHC 8.6
- Added \(O(n\log n)\) time closest pair algorithm.
- Added arrangement data type
- Various Bugfixes
- Added Camera data type with some world to screen transformations.
- Additional read/show instances
- Updated some of the show instances for Ipe related types.

** 0.7


- Compatibility with GHC 8.0-8.4
- Implemented more Algorithms and Data Structures. This includes
  * Polygon triangulation
- A new implementation of PlanarSubdivision that now also supports disconnected
  subdivsions.
- Performance improvements by changing to a different Vector
  implementation. For low dimensional vectors (of dimension at most four) we
  now essentially use the types from
  [linear](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/linear), this gives significant
  speedups on several small benchmarks.
- bugfixes.

** 0.6

- Implemented more Algorithms and Data Structures. This includes
  * Bentley-Ottmannn line-segment intersection,
  * Well-Separated Pair decompositions,
  * extremal point/tangents for Convex hulls,
  * Minkowski sum for convex polygons,
  * one dimensional segment trees,
  * one dimensional interval trees, and a
  * KD-tree.
- Several bug fixes, including a very stupid bug in Box
- Separate ConvexPolygon type.
- More thorough testing for some of the algorithms.
- Started work on a proper representation for planar subdivsions. This includes
  a representation of planar graphs that support querying if two vertices are
  connected by an edge in $O(1)$ time.
- Dropped support for GHC 7.8

** 0.5

- Implemented several algorithms, including Delaunay Triangulation, EMST, and
Douglas Peucker.
- Revamped the data types for Intersections

** 0.

- Major rewrite from scratch, providing much stronger type-level
  guarantees. Incompatible with older versions.
- Convex Hull and Smallest enclosing disk algorithms.
- HGeometry now includes some very experimental and preliminary support for
  reading and writing Ipe7 files.

** 0.2 & 0.3

- Internal releases.

** 0.1.1

- Fixed a bug in point on n the line segment test
- Generalized the types of inCircle, inDisc, onCircle, onDisc etc. We now need
  only that the type representing precision model implements the typeclass
  `Num` instead of `Floating'.

** 0.1

- Initial release.
